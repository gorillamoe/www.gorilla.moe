Some people have a wishlist on Amazon, which I also had for a long time.
I don't get along with the decision of Amazon to remove the ability
to have items outside from Amazon in the wishlist.

So I decided to create a wishlist on my own website.
This way I can also add things that aren't available on Amazon.
I will update this list from time to time.

I don't expect anyone to buy me something from this list.
It's more like a reminder for myself.

The order of the items isn't random.
It's more like a priority list.
