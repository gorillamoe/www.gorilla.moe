I've been testing out pop!\_os for a while now, and I must say that it is a great distro. It is fast, stable, and has a lot of great features.

But I've decided to switch back to Ubuntu and Gnome again. Here's why:

Mostly the lack of freshness of the packages in the repositories.

I know that I can add PPAs and use snaps and flatpaks,
but I prefer to use the official repositories whenever possible.

It started when I was trying to install Hyprland on pop!\_os.

I wasn't able to build it from source because of some missing dependencies,
and I wasn't able to find a package for it in the repositories.

Then I tried building it on Ubuntu, and it worked like a charm.
But then I realized that I missed Gnome and its simplicity.

So I decided to switch back to Ubuntu and Gnome again.

At the end of the day, it's all about personal preference and
I want a distro that works for me and that I feel comfortable with and
that gets out of my way when I'm working.

Ye ye, Arch-Users, I hear you already screaming,
but as a long-time Arch-User (like 10 years),
I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to spend my time
tweaking my system anymore.

And I know it's getting better, but I had 3 issues in the last 10y using Arch,
where I had to manually boot into a live system to fix it.

I simply don't want to deal with that (at least for now).
