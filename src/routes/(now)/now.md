Here is a list of things I am currently working on or learning.

## Kimbia 🐆

A minimal cross-platform task runner.

You can use Kimbia to run a series of tasks like linting, testing, building, and deploying your application.

You could also use a Makefile, bash- or npm-scripts, but Kimbia is easier to use and reason about.

Additionally, Kimbia supports dotenv files out of the box, is cross-platform, has documentation built-in and a simple and clean configuration file format.

Give it a [try](https://kimbia.mwco.app) and [let me know](https://bsky.app/profile/gorilla.moe) what you think.

## back to the arch 🐧

I'm back to Arch Linux, specifically to Manjaro.

I tried Ubuntu, but had some issues with the display, the performance, and occasionally freezing.

## getzana.net 📦

Zana is a minimal TUI for managing LSP servers, DAP servers, linters, and formatters, for Neovim, but not limited to just Neovim.

## getkulala.net 🐼

I am again working on the [kulala](https://getkulala.net) family.

Kulala is a minimal REST-Client Interface and set of tools for working with RESTful APIs. It also supports GraphQL.

I am currently working on a new product: [Kulala for Desktop](https://github.com/mistweaverco/kulala).

## Working on bananas 🍌

I am currently working on a new project called [bananas](https://getbananas.net).

Bananas Screen Sharing is a simple and easy-to-use screen sharing tool for
Mac, Windows, and Linux.

It utilizes a peer-to-peer connection to share your screen with others,
without the need for an account or any server infrastructure.

## Working on kulala.nvim and kulala-fmt

I am currently working on a new Neovim plugin called [kulala.nvim](https://kulala.mwco.app).

It is a replacement for the achieved [rest.nvim](https://github.com/rest-nvim/rest.nvim) plugin.

I started it, because I started a new job and
I needed a better tool for my daily work (mainly working with APIs).

I also started a new formatter called [kulala-fmt](https://github.com/mistweaverco/kulala-fmt).

It is a formatter for `.http` and `.rest` files and accompanies the kulala.nvim plugin.

## Getting started with bitbucket

We are using Bitbucket at work and I am currently getting all the ins and outs of it.

But, to be honest, I am not a big fan of it. I'm more of a GitHub person.

I'm missing a lot of features that GitHub has, like the GitHub CLI, GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages, etc.

## Started a new job

I started a new job at [TBInt](https://tbint.de) as a Cloud-Native Backend Developer.

I am working with Python, TypeScript, Docker, GCP, Terraform, GQL, SAP and a lot of other cool 😎 stuff.

That's so cool, because I previously (mostly) worked with AWS, Terraform, Docker, gRPC and TypeScript.

I am excited to work with a great team and to learn ✨ a lot of new things and make an impact 🥷.

I've never heard of TBInt before, but they are such a great 💪 and huge 🐋 company.

## Back to Gnome

Here I am again, back to Gnome.

I tried to switch to i3 and then to sway, but I missed some features and the simplicity of Gnome.

Too be honest, it just gets the job done and gets out of the way.

## ZSH hacking

I previously used `bash` as my shell, but I recently switched to `zsh`.

I started out with oh-my-zsh,
but I quickly realized that it's too bloated for my taste.

The startup time was a bit slow and I didn't need most of the features.
So I started to build my own setup from scratch.

With all the things shaved off that I don't need,
I managed to spin up a new shell twice as fast as before.

The greatest impact on the startup time was the removal of the `nvm` script.

But as I need `nvm` for my daily work,
I decided to try out lazy loading the `nvm` script.

This helped to shave off quite some time from the startup time.

I'm quite happy with the [results](https://github.com/gorillamoe/dotfiles/tree/trunk/configurations/zsh).
